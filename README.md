# Global Shark Attacks | Data Cleaning

## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to create a relational database from a series of totally independent tables by modifying those tables creating relationships between them and cleaning the tables in the best possible way.Then, we have to make some queries to check that the relationships we have established give us the information we want as a result. 

# Steps

-First of all, we shoud analyze the content of the data we have and the information provided by each of the tables in order to get a first idea of the possible future relationships. 

-Then, you must check the data type and cleanliness level of the tables in order to clean them. 

-Later, once the data is clean, you have to establish the relationship between each of the tables and modify them to establish the foreing keys between them 

-Finally, we have to create a database with the tables and columns we have, and upload the data with their relationships  

If you have done everything correctly, you should be able to make queries without any problem relating all the tables 

# Final conclusions 

I found it a very interesting project as it gives you a very general overview of how databases work and the relationship between each of the tables.In addition, I believe that once you understand how they work, it is easier to work with them and interpret them.
